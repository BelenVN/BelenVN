## üññüèºHello! 

I am a recently graduated junior Data Analyst willing to work and keep learning. 

## üå∏ About Me:

I'm enthusiastic and curious, and I truly enjoy the learning process. I'm passionate about new technologies and digital communication.

I'm a very creative person; art is a significant part of my life, and I'd love for it to be part of my work as well. That's why I've really enjoyed learning how to use tools like Power BI and Tableau. Actually I'm studying UX too!

Thanks to my background in technology, I've discovered how much I enjoy programming in languages like Python and SQL. I find it stimulating to figure out ways to create projects and query them through code.

- SQL: CRUD, advanced queries, data modeling
- Web Scraping: Beautiful Soup, Selenium
- Use of APIs
- Data Visualization: Tableau, Power BI
- Git: Version control (GitHub)

**Methods and Techniques:**
- EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis.
- ETL: Extract, Transform, Load.
- Task Automation.
- Statistical Analysis: Descriptive and inferential statistics.
- A/B Testing.
- Visualisation and Storytelling.

**Methodologies:**
- Agile Methodology.
  - Design Thinking. 
  - Scrum Framework.
